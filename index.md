<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a machine learning and analytics engineer working at [Occidental Petroleum](https://www.oxy.com/) based in Houston, Texas. My work involves using cutting edge machine- and deep learning techniques to solve problems in subsurface understanding for hydrocarbon exploration, environment monitoring, and sustainability applications. 

I hold a PhD degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://ece.gatech.edu/). My dissertation was completed under the supervision of Professor Ghassan AlRegib at the [OLIVES lab](https://ghassanalregib.info/). My research has focused on the automatic analysis and interpretation of high-dimensional spatiotemporal image signals, such as those present in migrated 3D seismic volumes (for geophysics exploration) and medical imaging data (for predictive analytics in healthcare). In particular, I have worked on developing an array of deep learning algorithms for solving multimodal inverse problems in geophysics, for the accurate segmentation of spatiotemporal image data towards subsurface characterization and automatic tumour detection, and for addressing domain shift for the real world application of deep models pretrained on synthetic training data. Additionally, I have worked on researching weakly supervised learning and active learning for the accurate semantic segmentation of 2D/3D image signals in sparse label settings.

Aside from my research engagments, I have delivered numerous talks and short courses across industry and academic settings and have been involved with numerous research intiatives involving industry and academia. I have served as a mentor and advisor to students and early-career researchers, fostering knowledge exchange through technical workshops and industry partnerships. I welcome collaborations that push the boundaries of AI-driven signal processing, particularly in domains where high-dimensional data and complex physics-based constraints pose unique challenges.
