<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a machine learning and analytics engineer working at [Occidental Petroleum](https://www.oxy.com/) based in Houston, Texas. My work involves using cutting edge machine- and deep learning techniques to solve problems in subsurface understanding for hydrocarbon exploration, environment monitoring, and sustainability applications. 

I hold a PhD degree in Electrical Engineering at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://ece.gatech.edu/) with a minor in Maths. My dissertation was completed under the supervision of Professor Ghassan AlRegib at the [OLIVES lab](https://ghassanalregib.info/). My research focused on developing novel deep learning techniques to address the problem of label sparsity for subsurface characterization. Prior to this, I obtained my Masters degree (also in Electrical Engineering) at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and seismic interpretation for a variety of subsurface applications. I have worked on solving seismic inverse problems through integration of multi-modal subsurface data, developed an active learning technique to reduce dependency on labeled training examples for ML-based interpretation, and worked on modeling human visual attention to account for incomplete, missing training labels to train deep models for subsurface interpretation applications. Additionally, I am also working on understanding the interaction of seismic amplitude anomalies for reduce drilling uncertainty for hydrocarbon exploration using Explainable AI. My research has featured in top-tier peer reviewed academic journals, conference proceedings, and technical meeting presentations.
